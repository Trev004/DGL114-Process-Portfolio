I consider Reddit's mobile interface to be good because it keeps it simple but not to the point where it's hard to do anything. The two most commonly used buttons are on the bottom left that show your feeds, and what communities that you're following so you can quickly go to any community you want and view posts made on there.

I consider Spotify's app to be more difficult to use, mostly due to the fact that the home page feels cluttered. It also doesn't help that the library page shows icons for the playlists, meaning less can fit on one page requiring you to scroll down to find playlists that are on the bottom.

**Activity 0102**<br>
- Usable
  - Content on the home page
  - Useful buttons
  - Clear divide between what is the home and what is extra/side content
- Intuitive
  - House/Logo will always take you to the home/main page of the app
  - Useful icons that don't require the user to read the text under it
  - Content is where you'd expect it to be. No settings/extra content on the main page for example
