A Process Portfolio for DGL 114, Intro to Mobile App Development

### Week 1
**Activity 0101** <br>

I consider **Reddit's** mobile interface to be good because it keeps it simple but not to the point where it's hard to do anything. The two most commonly used buttons are on the bottom left that show your feeds, and what communities that you're following so you can quickly go to any community you want and view posts made on there.

I consider **Spotify's** app to be more difficult to use, mostly due to the fact that the home page feels cluttered. It also doesn't help that the library page shows icons for the playlists, meaning less can fit on one page requiring you to scroll down to find playlists that are on the bottom.

**Activity 0102**<br>
- Usable
  - Content on the home page
  - Useful buttons
  - Clear divide between what is the home and what is extra/side content
- Intuitive
  - House/Logo will always take you to the home/main page of the app
  - Useful icons that don't require the user to read the text under it
  - Content is where you'd expect it to be. No settings/extra content on the main page for example

### Week 2
**Activity 0202: Reddit** <br>
<img src="Images/DGL_114_Task1_Screenshot1.png" alt="Model View Controller of Reddit" width="200px">
- Model
  - Subreddit icons/names
  - User's icon at the top left
  - Upvote/Downvote icons clicked yes/no
- View
  - Subreddit icons/names again as you can also click on them
  - The 5 icons at the bottom
  - Profile icon at the top left
  - Coins icon at the top right
- Controller
  - Upvote/Downvote icons
  - Comments, Share and the Award buttons

**Activity 0203** <br>
The Material.io article on [Iconography](https://material.io/design/iconography/product-icons.html) breaks down the "proper" way to design icons for one's brand. It gives a super basic breakdown of how to think about designing an icon, from what the material is made of, to how it interacts with a lighscource. Terminology relevant to the process is also covered and shown with examples, like *Finish, Material background and foreground, Colour and Shadows.* It also covers the do's and don'ts of icon design, though it does make you think about it, or at least brings it to your attention as to why you think something looks good. If you were to follow all of the do's presented on this page though, the icon you'd make would look very similar to everything Google has made and used for their icons.

### Week 3
